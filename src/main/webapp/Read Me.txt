Project Title: Category Management System using JSP and MySQL

Project Description:

This project implements a web-based Category Management System using Java Server Pages (JSP) for the front-end and MySQL for the back-end database. The system provides a user-friendly interface to manage categories within a database, enabling users to create, view, and delete category records.

Key Features:

Category Creation:
	Allows users to add new categories to the MySQL database through a simple web form.
	Input validation ensures data integrity before insertion.
	
Category Retrieval (Selection):
	Displays a list of all existing categories stored in the database.
	Presents the category data in a clear 89632and organized table format.
	
Category Deletion:
	Provides functionality to remove categories from the database.
	Implements confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletions.
	
Database Connectivity:
	Establishes a connection to a MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
	Executes SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, DELETE) to interact with the database.
	
JSP Technology:
	Utilizes JSP for dynamic web page generation, separating presentation from business logic.
	Employs JSP scripting elements and JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) for efficient data handling and display.
	
MySQL Database:
	Stores category data in a relational database, ensuring data persistence and integrity.
	Utilizes SQL for database operations.
	
Technologies Used:
	Java Server Pages (JSP): For dynamic web page development.
	Java Database Connectivity (JDBC): For connecting to the MySQL database.
	MySQL: For database storage and management.
	HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript: For front-end user interface design and interactivity.
	SQL: For database querying and manipulation.
	JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) (Optional but recommended): for cleaner jsp code.
	Functionality Overview:

The system presents a web interface where users can:
	Add a new category: They will enter the category name in a form, and the system will store it in the database.
	
	View existing categories: The system will display a table containing all the categories stored in the database.
	
	Delete a category: Users can select a category from the list and delete it from the database.
	
Purpose:
	This project serves as a practical demonstration of using JSP and MySQL for basic database-driven web applications. It provides a foundation for more complex web systems that require category management or similar data manipulation functionalities

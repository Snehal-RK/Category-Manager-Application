# *Project Title* : *_Category Management System using JSP and MySQL_*
<br>

### *Project Description :*

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This project implements a web-based Category Management System using *Java Server Pages (JSP)* for the front-end and MySQL for the back-end database. The system provides a user-friendly interface to manage categories within a database, enabling users to create, view, and delete category records.

<br>

### *Key Features :*

Category Creation : 
- Allows users to add new categories to the MySQL database through a simple web form.
- Input validation ensures data integrity before insertion.

Category Retrieval (Selection):
 - Displays a list of all existing categories stored in the database.
 - Presents the category data in a clear and organized table format.

Category Deletion:
 - Provides functionality to remove categories from the database.
 - Implements confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletions.

Database Connectivity :
 - Establish a connection to a MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
 - Executes SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, DELETE) to interact with the database.

JSP Technology:
 - Utilizes JSP for dynamic web page generation, seperating presentation from business logic.
 - Employs JSP scripting elements for efficient data handling and display.

MySQL Database:
 - Stores category data in a relational database, ensuring data persistance and integrity.
 - Utilizes SQL for database operations.

<br>

### *Technologies Used* :

- Java Server Pages (JSP): For dynamic web page development.
  
- Java Database Connectivity (JDBC): For connecting to the MySQL database.
  
- MySQL: For database storage and management.
  
- HTML, CSS, BootStrap and potentially JavaScript: For front-end user interface design and interactivity.
  
- SQL: For database querying and mainpulation.

<br>

### *_Functional Overview_*: <br>
The system presents a web interface where users can: <br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Add* a new category: They will enter the category name in a form, and the system will store it in the database. <br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*View* existing categories: The system will display a table containing all the categories stored in the database. <br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;*Delete* a category: Users can select a category from the list and delete it from the database. <br>

### *Purpose* :
	
  *This project serves as a practical demonstration of using JSP and MySQL for basic database-driven web applications. It provides a foundation for more complex web systems that require category management or similar data manipulation functionalities.*
